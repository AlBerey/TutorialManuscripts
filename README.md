# TutorialManuscripts

This directory contains the last version of the tutorial manuscripts by Ali Bereyhi for the lectures "Information Theory and Coding" and "Mobile Communications" at FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg, Germany.

The manuscripts are updated each semester and for sure contain typos and mistaks. Please feel free to let me know about the mistakes. You can always write me at ali.bereyhi@fau.de or ali.bereyhi@gmail.com
